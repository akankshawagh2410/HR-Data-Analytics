# HR-Data-Analytics

In a company there are around 4500 employees and every year 15% employees are leaving the company.We have to analyze the reason as well as we will predict based on the feature if employee will leave the company or not.
So we have 5 datasets for this particular problem:
<li>general_data - It contains general information
<li>manager_survey_data - It contains survey data of manager.
<li>employee_survey_data - It contains survey data of employee.
<li>in_time - It contains office entry time of employee.
<li>out_time - It contains office exit time of employee.
  
Conclusion:
The few major causes of employee attrition observed during EDA are-

1.Human Resource Work

2.Bad work Life Balance

3.Single Employees

4.Frequent Travels

Therefore, in order to reduce attrition company should focus more on these reasons.
