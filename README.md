# HR-Data-Analytics

This project predicts whether the employees will leave the company or not by using Decision Tree Classifier. With the help of Exploratory Data Analysis we drew few conclusions as well.
<br>So we have 5 datasets for this particular problem:
<li>general_data - It contains general information
<li>manager_survey_data - It contains survey data of manager.
<li>employee_survey_data - It contains survey data of employee.
<li>in_time - It contains office entry time of employee.
<li>out_time - It contains office exit time of employee.
  
Conclusion:
The few major causes of employee attrition observed during EDA are-

1.Human Resource Work

2.Bad work Life Balance

3.Single Employees

4.Frequent Travels

Therefore, in order to reduce attrition company should focus more on these reasons.
